# Ai-CAR-PARKING-

INTRODUCTION:To finding parking availability for a specific time period is a very tedious job in urban areas. The Indian government now focusing on the smart city project, already they published city name for an upcoming smart city project. In smart city application , intelligent transportation system (ITS) plays an important role- in that finding parking place, specifically for thecar owner to avoid time computation, as well as congestion in traffic isgoing to be very important. In this article, we propose an intelligent car  parking system for the smart city using Circle Hough Transform (CHT).Keywords- Intelligent transportation system (ITS), Circle HoughTransform (CHT), Circle detection, Video-Image processing, smart city, parking system , OpenCV. For today's traffic monitoring and itsmanagement is a recent trend in research development. In this paper, weare focusing on parking component of the traffic parameter. Traffic verycongested from last decade due to the increasing rise of automobilecompanies offers to a customer, privatization of that- mainly more andmore used in present day compared to last decade and it's also increasing inthe future may be with same or more speed. So now government thinkinghow to solve this problem in real time? Within specified time duration.


1.2 PURPOSE:
Itallows car park operators and companies to track their facilities, vehicleentry, and real-time reporting of the availability of parking spots. Thishelps companies manage their parks in a central digital hub offered with parking software.
1.Superior TechnologyParking management systems are known for their integration withtechnology.
Most of these systems are based on improved models andtechnological innovations, due to which they are suited to be used invarious car parks.
2.Better parking experienceBetter car park management means happier customers.
  A parkingmanagement system enhances the customer journey by providing themwith a unified procedure.
3.Increased ProtectionParking management systems have technologically advanced securityfeatures that enable you to prevent parking misuse and suspicious activityin your parking facility
4.Reduced traffic and pollutionVehicles that keep circling an area in search of an empty parking spacecause most of the city traffic. Moreover, significantly driving around or waiting for a parking space to be vacant burns through a lot of fuel andreleases emissions daily.
5.Easy implementation and managementAnother of the benefit of a parking management system is that it canefficiently be designed and implemented. These systems have a well-organised structure
6.Cost-effectiveAnother advantage that you obtain from installing a smart parkingmanagement system is the cost. It runs on a low workforce, so you cansave money and time
7.Uses integrated software and applicationsParking management solutions use software and applications that can becombined with another. Depending on your car parkâ€™s requirements, thereare lots of customisations available.
